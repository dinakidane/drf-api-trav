## Agile Methodology

- Agile methodology is an approach to project management and software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It involves breaking down projects into smaller, manageable tasks, which are then completed in short iterations or sprints. This method allows for continuous improvement and adaptability to changing requirements.

In my project, I used Agile methodology to create and manage project boards on GitHub. I organized my tasks into three columns: 'To Do', 'In Progress', and 'Done'. This setup helped me clearly see the status of each task and prioritize my work efficiently. By regularly updating the board, I ensured that all tasks were tracked and completed systematically. Over time, this approach kept me organized and provided a clear overview of what needed to be done, what was in progress, and what was already completed. This continuous tracking and updating process helped me stay on top of my project and ensured that nothing was overlooked.
