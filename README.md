## Agile Methodology

- Agile methodology is an approach to project management and software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It involves breaking down projects into smaller, manageable tasks, which are then completed in short iterations or sprints. This method allows for continuous improvement and adaptability to changing requirements.

- In this project, Agile methodology was used to create and manage project boards on GitHub. The tasks were organised into three columns: 'To Do', 'In Progress', and 'Done'. This setup helped clear up the status of each task and prioritize the work efficiently. By regularly updating the board, it was ensured that all tasks were tracked and completed systematically. Over time, this approach kept everything organized and provided a clear overview of what needed to be done, what was in progress, and what was already completed. This continuous tracking and updating process allowed the project to work smoothly and ensured that nothing was overlooked.
